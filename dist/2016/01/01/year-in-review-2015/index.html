          <p>My narrative arc for 2015 was fit for a Focus Features indie film. I had recently moved back to the Midwest suburb I grew up in, bending some ties with the tech-soaked bonanza that is the sweat-stained city of Chicago. I had replaced nightlife with family, coffee shops with pajamas, and brimmed with unyielding consistency rather than the potent excitement of urban enthusiasm. </p><p>I traded the ever-inspiring machinery of the Chicago Transit Authority with the reliability of a Honda Civic; swiping a credit card to the tune of a gas station radio advertisement while fondly remembering ganging up on dirty turnstiles with the greater Chicago workforce—bludgeoning ignorant sensors with our crusty pieces of plastic money.</p><p>It wasn’t easy. I’d be lying if I said the past year was particularly exciting outside of the work week. It had its moments though.</p><h2 id="jake-it-til-you-make-it-">Jake it ‘til you make it.</h2><p>The greatest takeaway I have from this year can only be directly adopted by a very narrow vector of the coding populous.</p><p>The phrase, “Fake it ‘til you make it” is a deceitful one—convoluted at the very least. The implication is that one is incapable of doing whatever it is that they are faking. That is a lie. The goal of this phrase is to keep one inspired and humble enough to continue pushing forward, and yet the assumption of incapability is the very idea that keeps people from doing things. This is why I amended it to be:</p><blockquote class="center-quote">Jake it ‘til you make it.</blockquote><p>I am me and you are you. We are capable of whatever we set our minds to. I am <em>jaking</em> it, simply because that is all I am capable of doing. Attempting something I haven’t attempted before is scary, but it does <em>not</em> mean I cannot do it. I am not <em>faking</em> it when I build something for the first time. I am <em>doing</em> it. Sure, there is a variable degree of success in my attempts, but that doesn’t dictate whether or not I am a good developer. Trying things is doing things. You are a good developer if you are trying.</p><p>I hope you are capable of coming up with a similar pun that uses your name, because this is true for you too.</p><h2 id="things-i-did-in-2015">Things I Did in 2015</h2><p>I <em>jaked</em> some things this year.

I have enjoyed my three months at CodePen more than is humanly possible and am overwhelmingly excited about what the future holds there. I think the thing that really means the most to me about this is the fact that I have an opportunity to make a thing that helps me learn, makes me friends, and inspires me do the same for other people. I grew up thinking I was dumb.

That’s about all I feel comfortable anticipating in 2016. Don’t get me wrong—I am excited and I am optimistic. It is just that I find the discipline of looking back, relishing, and learning from what has <em>actually</em> taken place far more crucial. We are fast-paced. We code shit and we move on. Let the stuff you have done sink in—you actually did things. The things you did weren’t perfect, but <em>you</em> are active. Let <em>that</em> spur you onward. </p><p>You are capable. </p><p>Jake it ‘til you make it.</p>

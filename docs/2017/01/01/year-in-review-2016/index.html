          <p>2016 has come and gone and with it my sense of displacement as I spent the year nestling back into the city I consider synonymous with home. I applied the patchwork of nostalgia in my choice to move back to the Logan Square neighborhood, and seemingly encountered a train that has not stopped steamrolling since I left it in 2014. This place has not felt more or less like my own. </p><p>Everything moves in and bound to time. To pause is an illusion. Things are never precisely where we left them. It is not with mourning that I engage this reality, rather with vigor as I elect to be captured sprinting along a blurred backdrop in the exposed frames of my existence.</p><p><img src="/media/2017-01-01/backdrop.jpg" alt="Backdrop"></p><p>For me, this past year was about inspiration. I witnessed people creating, encouraging, and empowering others in ways I can only strive to invoke; observations which directly translated into a very inspired year.</p><p>Being able to pause and recognize a completed year is important. One must not let oneself drift onward, focused solely on a theoretical future while disregarding the present and past reality. Progress is measured not by what is to come, but by what has been done. I am too easily distracted by the idea of getting better at what I do and would encourage you to join me in taking note of how we have moved this year and then to embrace it.</p><p>This year you may have fought personal battles or you may have been swept up in the greater battles that became surprisingly real to many of us. If in any way you feel less capable of existing, I urge you on behalf of all of us, to keep creating and speaking. We live in a world that in spite of its overwhelming capacity for disappointment is stocked with thinkers and doers that will refuse to let deaf ears make them mute. You are alive and operational, and in many senses your perseverance is remarkable. </p><h1 id="community">Community</h1><h3 id="codepen-chicago">CodePen Chicago</h3><p>This year we had five CodePen Chicago meetups. A year ago, when I first decided to step out of my developer hole, aka <em>my close-circuited incubator of self-doubt</em>, I emerged from the womb as a nervous man-baby at <a href="http://codepen.io/poopsplat/post/first-codepen-chicago-meetup">the first CodePen Chicago in April of 2015</a>. </p><p><em>Do I actually just suck at this?</em> </p><p>Up until that point, I had built a limited world for myself—a developer in a sea of non-developers. No one to admonish critique, everyone easy to impress, and failure came easily managed or at the very least disguised by the mystique of code. To leave that comfort and surround myself with other developers was to potentially expose myself in heresy. I found myself in the pale pink of my fragility crawling through the doors of Workshop Chicago, with a man-bun levitating along my neck, and a self-coding pen in the proverbial diaper.</p><p><img src="/media/2017-01-01/meetup-1.jpg" alt="CodePen Chicago April 2015"></p><p>That evening I was greeted by human beings. People that had their own insecurities, triumphs, humility, and inspirations. This was a foundational moment in my existence as a developer. What I found there, between projected lines of JavaScript, was not the admiration fit to curb an unrelenting self-consciousness that I had assumed necessary for my thriving—I found people that I wanted to walk with.</p><p><img src="/media/2017-01-01/meetup-2.jpg" alt="CodePen Chicago August 2016"></p><p>And walked we have. The weight of these meetups has challenged me to create and the depth has presented an eternal stream of inspiration. The potency of collaboration, not in work but in life has continued to greet myself as well as others who have come into the fold. I am proud to say that this stayed true five times this year and I look forward to it continuing through 2017.</p><p><img src="/media/2017-01-01/meetup-3.jpg" alt="CodePen Chicago June 2016"></p><h3 id="codepen-tampa">CodePen Tampa</h3><p>This past October I completed my first year as an engineer at <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>. This job has been more fulfilling than the high expectation that I had set. Most notably, I am surrounded by six amazing coworkers focused not just on making CodePen great, but helping each other thrive. Team CodePen works remotely and no one is in the same state, so it was pure revelry when we met up last March in Tampa.</p><p><img src="/media/2017-01-01/codepen-tampa.jpg" alt="CodePen in Tampa March 2016"></p><p>There are a lot of exciting things on the horizon at CodePen, I am looking forward to seeing them through this next year. The transition from being predominantly a front end developer to the back end has been the sort of challenge that ceases to feel like a challenge due to its perfect fit. I love every aspect about what I do from the structural to the organizational to the technical. I feel grateful to be in a place where I have the freedom to grow and enough trust to take on new challenges.</p><h1 id="talks">Talks</h1><h3 id="codepen-community">CodePen &amp; Community</h3><p>I gave a talk at Trulia about CodePen and Community and wrote a <a href="http://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/post/codepen-community">long form version</a> of the talk on CodePen as well as a companion <a href="http://blog.jakealbaugh.com/2016/04/13/speaking/">emotional post about not being good enough to speak</a> here on my blog.</p><p><img src="/media/2017-01-01/cpsf.jpg" alt="CodePen Meetup at Trulia April 2016"></p><h3 id="wildhacks">Wildhacks</h3><p>I was asked to keynote and judge at <a href="https://twitter.com/nuwildhacks/">Wildhacks 2016</a> over at Northwestern University this year along with <a href="https://twitter.com/broccolini">Diana Mounter</a>. I gave a talk on the value of creativity and Diana gave an awesome talk called, “Competence, Compassion, and Confidence”. I had a blast hanging with all these skilled kids and they absolutely killed it.</p><p><img src="/media/2017-01-01/wildhacks.jpg" alt="Wildhacks November 2016"></p><h1 id="a-dumb-brand">A Dumb Brand</h1><p>I always enjoy doing something different with my identity every year. 2016’s attempt turned out to be fairly accurate.</p><p><iframe height="398" scrolling="no" title="Profile Header 3.0" src="//codepen.io/jakealbaugh/embed/qZVRrb/?height=398&theme-id=21346&default-tab=result&embed-version=2" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" style="width: 100%;">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/full/qZVRrb/">Profile Header 3.0</a> by Jake Albaugh (<a href="http://codepen.io/jakealbaugh">@jakealbaugh</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</iframe> <!-- iframe --></p><h1 id="fuzzy-search">Fuzzy Search</h1><p>I made one truly useful thing outside of my job at CodePen this year. It is a “Fuzzy Search” library that allows you to search strings partially or completely.

The further you scroll, the more music is generated. The entire performance is stored as DOM content so you can go backwards through what you generated, and you can select auto scroll and the screen will scroll down at a constant rate.</p><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/111863/2016-portfolio-LGmygN.png" alt=""></p><p>You can try it out yourself <a href="http://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/full/LGmygN">on CodePen</a>.</p><h3 id="step-o-matic">Step-o-matic</h3><p>I decided to try and make a step sequencer using <a href="http://tonejs.org">Tone.js</a> and that turned into the <a href="http://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/full/dGqXgp">Step-o-matic</a>. The major features are the ability to set it to more or less than four beats, program a basic customizable drum kit, have full control over the key, and save/load your program.</p><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/111863/2016-portfolio-dGqXgp.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="chance-the-rapper">Chance the Rapper</h3><p>I also made a few Chance the Rapper-flavored pens.

There are five patterns in different time signatures. These patterns loop on top off each other, creating polyrhythms. They take turns being the primary pattern. When they are primary, their octave is shifted up and the drum plays a beat in the given rhythm. The primary pattern only shifts when the current and next pattern end at the same time to have a clean hand off.

          <p>2016 has come and gone and with it my sense of displacement as I spent the year nestling back into the city I consider synonymous with home. I applied the patchwork of nostalgia in my choice to move back to the Logan Square neighborhood, and seemingly encountered a train that has not stopped steamrolling since I left it in 2014. This place has not felt more or less like my own. </p><p>Everything moves in and bound to time. To pause is an illusion. Things are never precisely where we left them. It is not with mourning that I engage this reality, rather full of vigor as I elect to be captured sprinting along a blurred background in the exposed frames of my existence.</p><h1 id="in-a-nutshell">In a Nutshell</h1><p>For me, this past year was about inspiration. I witnessed people creating, encouraging, and empowering other people in ways I can only strive to apply, which directly translated into a very inspired year.</p><p>Being able to pause and recognize what I have done this year is important. One must not let oneself drift steadily onward, focused solely on a theoretical future while disregarding the present and past reality. Progress is not what is to come, it is what has been done. I’m too easily distracted by the idea of getting better at what I do and would encourage you join me in taking note of what we have done this year and embrace it. You have done things. You are alive and operational. In many senses, your perseverance is remarkable. </p><p>This year you may have fought personal battles or you may have been swept up in the greater battles that became surprisingly real to many of us. If in any way you feel less capable of existing, I urge you on behalf of all of us, to keep creating, speaking, and listening. We are in a world that in spite of its overwhelming capacity for disappointment is stocked with thinkers and doers that will refuse to let deaf ears make them mute.</p><p><em>Keep going.</em></p><p>With that in mind, here is how I spent 2016.</p><h1 id="community">Community</h1><h3 id="codepen-chicago">CodePen Chicago</h3><p>This year we had five CodePen Chicago meetups. A year ago, when I first decided to step out of my developer hole, aka <em>my close-circuited incubator of self-doubt</em>, I emerged from the womb as a nervous man-baby at <a href="http://codepen.io/poopsplat/post/first-codepen-chicago-meetup">the first CodePen Chicago in April of 2015</a>. <em>“Do I actually just suck at this?”</em> Up until that point, I had built a world for myself—a developer in a sea of non-developers. No one to admonish critique, everyone easy to impress, and failure came easily managed or disguised by the mystique of code. To leave that world and surround myself with other developers was to potentially expose myself in heresy. I found myself in the pale pink of my fragility crawling through the doors of Workshop Chicago, with a man-bun levitating along my neck, and a self-coding pen in the proverbial diaper.</p><p>That evening I was greeted by human beings. People that had their own insecurities, triumphs, humility, and inspirations. This was a foundational moment in my existence as a developer. What I found there, between projected lines of JavaScript, was not the admiration fit to curb an unrelenting self-consciousness that I had assumed I needed. I found people that I wanted to walk with.</p><p>And walked we have. The weight of these meetups has challenged me to create and the depth has presented an eternal stream of inspiration. The potency of collaboration, not in work but in life has continued to greet myself as well as others who have come into the fold. I am proud to say that this stayed true five times this year and I look forward to it continuing through 2017.</p><h3 id="awesome-people-with-awesome-nbsp-things">Awesome People With Awesome&nbsp;Things</h3><p>Through some tremendous friends at <a href="https://theuprisingcreative.com/">The Uprising Creative</a>, I was introduced to my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/nealsales">Neal Sàles-Griffin</a>, who is now CEO at <a href="https://www.codenow.org/">CodeNow</a>, an organization that, “Empowers teenagers to solve meaningful problems with technology.” Through my relationship with Neal, I have been encouraged in my passion for using code as a medium for growth in areas of need, specifically in Chicago. Neal has an incredible story as a Chicagoan and passion as an individual, and it would be a disservice to try and explain it as well and concisely as he did in his post, <a href="https://medium.com/codenow/my-story-an-introduction-to-codenows-impact-93bbf2c485b4#.8o89bt3gx">My Story: An Introduction to CodeNow’s Impact</a>. His passion inspires me, and I look forward to applying that inspiration this year.</p><p>I also met <a href="https://twitter.com/cadler">Charles Adler</a> this year. Charles runs <a href="http://lostarts.co/">Lost Arts</a> here in Chicago. Lost Arts is about empowerment at the individual level, whether it is in manufacturing, prototyping, woodworking, or 3D design and printing. I had the opportunity to check out the current space and was beyond encouraged by the clear vision Lost Arts has for creators, so encouraged that I went home and proceeded to design some speaker stands.</p><h1 id="talks">Talks</h1><h3 id="codepen-community">CodePen &amp; Community</h3><p>I gave a talk at Trulia about CodePen and Community and wrote a <a href="http://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/post/codepen-community">long form version</a> of the talk on CodePen as well as a companion <a href="http://blog.jakealbaugh.com/2016/04/13/speaking/">emotional post about not being good enough to speak</a> here on my blog.</p><h3 id="wildhacks">Wildhacks</h3><p>I was asked to keynote and judge at <a href="https://twitter.com/nuwildhacks/">Wildhacks 2016</a> over at Northwestern University this year along with <a href="https://twitter.com/broccolini">Diana Mounter</a>. I gave a talk on the value of creativity and Diana gave an awesome talk called, “Competence, Compassion, and Confidence”. I had a blast hanging with all these skilled kids and they absolutely killed it.</p><p><img src="/media/2017-01-01/wildhacks.jpg" alt=""></p><h1 id="tools">Tools</h1><h3 id="fuzzy-search">Fuzzy Search</h3><p>I made one truly useful thing outside of my job at CodePen this year. It is a “Fuzzy Search” library that allows you to search strings partially or completely.

The further you scroll, the more music is generated. The entire performance is stored as DOM content so you can go backwards through what you generated, and you can select auto scroll and the screen will scroll down at a constant rate.</p><p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/111863/2016-portfolio-LGmygN.png" alt=""></p><p>You can try it out yourself <a href="http://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/full/LGmygN">on CodePen</a>.</p><h3 id="step-o-matic">Step-o-matic</h3><p>I decided to try and make a step sequencer using <a href="http://tonejs.org">Tone.js</a> and that turned into the <a href="http://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/full/dGqXgp">Step-o-matic</a>.

There are five patterns in different time signatures. These patterns loop on top off each other, creating polyrhythms. They take turns being the primary pattern. When they are primary, their octave is shifted up and the drum plays a beat in the given rhythm. The primary pattern only shifts when the current and next pattern end at the same time to have a clean hand off.

    <p>
      I am an engineer at
      <a href="https://www.vinylmeplease.com/">Vinyl Me, Please</a>,
      previously at <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a> and am
      enthusiastic about teaching and learning code. I also have a
      passion for creating and capturing noise as well as writing words.
